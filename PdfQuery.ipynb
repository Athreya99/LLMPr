Introduction\\nOn March 9, 2022, President Biden signed an Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible \\nDevelopment of Digital Assets (Executive Order).1  Section 4(b) of the Executive Order directs \\nthe Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Attorney \\nGeneral, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of \\nthe Office of Management and Budget, the Director of National Intelligence, and the heads \\nof other relevant agencies, to submit to the President a report on the future of money and \\npayment systems.\\nThis report reviews the current U.S. system of money and payments, including developments \\nin instant payments and stablecoins.  It also describes design choices for a potential U.S. \\nCentral Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the context of public policy considerations related \\nto building the future of money and payments, supporting U.S. global financial leadership, \\nadvancing financial inclusion and equity, and minimizing risks.  \\nMoney serves three core functions: a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of \\nvalue.  It can be public money—primarily a liability of the central bank—or private money—a \\nliability of a private intermediary.  Payment systems transfer money.  Consumers and \\nbusinesses use retail payment systems for transactions that typically involve smaller dollar \\namounts; banks and other financial institutions use wholesale payment systems that gener -\\nally involve larger dollar amounts. \\nThe central bank is at the center of the monetary system.  Reflecting this position, central \\nbank money tends to underpin interbank payments and serve as the backbone of the \\nbroader payment system. 2   In addition, the Federal Reserve provides currency and reserve \\nbalances, operates payment systems, and supervises certain intermediaries that issue private \\nmoney and make payments.  Even as the money and payment system evolves, the central \\nbank’s role in final settlement must be preserved to promote economic growth, efficiency, \\nand other public interests.  \\nThe current U.S. system of money and payments has substantial strengths.  The system has \\nsupported over a century of U.S. economic and financial leadership.  It is also capable of pro -\\ncessing an enormous volume of transactions in an efficient and reliable manner, and users \\nof the payment system enjoy privacy protections.  On the other hand, certain legacy payment \\nsystems can be slow, difficult to adapt, and challenging for some consumers or businesses \\nto access.  In addition, the United States has a significant population that is underserved \\n1  Exec. Order No. 14067, 87 Fed. Reg. 14143 (March 9, 2022).\\n2  See generally  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank \\nDoes  Ch. 6 (11th ed. 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/the-fed-explained.pdf .\\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nIntroduction\\n1by existing systems, indicating there remain substantial opportunities to promote broader \\nfinancial inclusion.3\\nRecent innovations in money and payments, including instant payment systems and stable -\\ncoins, could have far-reaching implications.  Instant payment systems generally preserve the \\ncore features of existing money and payment systems, while offering faster, more efficient, \\nand potentially more inclusive ways to pay.  Stablecoins aspire to be a new type of money \\nsupported by a novel payments technology, with implications for the payment system that \\nare more difficult to predict. \\nAgainst this backdrop, this report makes recommendations designed to improve the U.S. \\nsystem of money and payments so that it best achieves a range of policy goals. The recom -\\nmendations are for the U.S. government to:\\n• Recommendation 1 : Advance work on a possible U.S. CBDC, in case one is deter -\\nmined to be in the national interest.\\n• Recommendation 2 :  Encourage use of instant payment systems to support a more \\ncompetitive, efficient, and inclusive U.S. payment landscape.\\n• Recommendation 3 : Establish a federal framework for payments regulation to \\nprotect users and the financial system, while supporting responsible innovations in \\npayments.\\n• Recommendation 4 : Prioritize efforts to improve cross-border payments, both to \\nenhance payment system efficiency and protect national security.\\n3  See Section II, infra  (citing and discussing, in the consumers and payments box, statistics regarding the use of finan -\\ncial services in the United States, including that the percentage of those who are unbanked in the United States is \\nhigher than in all other G-7 countries).\\nIntroduction \\n2II. Money and payments\\nMoney, payments, and the current payment system\\nMoney\\nMoney serves three core functions.4  First, money must serve as a unit of account, which \\nmeans that it can be used to price goods and services.  Second, money must serve as a \\nmedium of exchange in commerce to buy and sell goods and services.  Third, money must \\nserve as a store of value.  That means the value of money is generally preserved over time.   \\nMoney comes in two forms: public and private.  Today, U.S. public money primarily consists \\nof central bank money, which is a liability issued by the Federal Reserve.5  The general public \\nuses public money in the form of paper currency, or Federal Reserve notes, for everyday \\ntransactions.  Banks and certain other institutions can access central bank reserve balances.6  \\nCoin is also considered public money and is issued by the Treasury.  There are $2.2 trillion in \\nFederal Reserve notes, $3.3 trillion in reserve balances, and $50 billion in coin outstanding.7\\nPrivate money includes “commercial bank money”—dollar-denominated balances in \\ncommercial bank accounts.8  Certain other liabilities of nonbanks, such as balances held with \\nfinancial technology (fintech) firms, other nonbank financial institutions, or other payments \\nproviders to effect transfers, can also be viewed as private money.9  There is currently at least \\n$19.4 trillion in private money in the United States.10  \\n4  A historical source for this taxonomy (along with a fourth function, standard of value) is W.

Because public money is \\ncurrently only accessible to the general public as paper currency or coins, private money can \\nbe more convenient for the public to use to make payments.  And while public and private \\nmoney may often be interchangeable in their use—a consumer may pay for the same goods \\nand services using cash or bank deposits with equal ease—the safety and liquidity of public \\nand private money differ.  Central bank money presents no credit or liquidity risk.  Because \\nof this, settlement in central bank money eliminates uncertainty in transactions, supporting \\neconomic activity and financial stability.  By contrast, private money may present credit or \\nliquidity risk, depending on the solvency and liquidity of the issuer, as well as the availability \\nof a government backstop (e.g., a central bank lender of last resort or deposit insurance).  \\nPrivate money usually promises conversion on a one-for-one basis into public money, on \\ndemand.  Because of this feature, private money is susceptible to runs.  Runs can happen \\nwhen the solvency or the liquidity of the assets or liabilities of the private money issuer come \\ninto question, and holders of private money seek to convert to public money.  The risk of \\nruns at federally and state-chartered insured depository institutions is mitigated substantially \\nthrough prudential supervision and regulation, eligibility to access the discount window, and \\nfederal deposit insurance.11  But not all private money enjoys similar safeguards and therefore \\nsome issuers of private money may be more susceptible to runs.12 \\nPayment systems\\nPayment systems facilitate the exchange of goods and services for money and, as such, \\nenable the economy to function.  A payment system is a set of rules and processes for \\ntransferring money.  A payment involves sharing and verifying instructions (e.g., How much? \\nTo whom?), in a process referred to as “clearing,” and the transfer of funds to discharge the \\nobligation, referred to as “settlement.”13  Clearing and settlement in payment systems require \\n(1) parties to the transaction and a network of participants – a sender, a receiver, and often \\none or more financial institutions; (2) an asset or set of assets that are transferred among \\nthose participants; and (3) a transfer process that defines the procedures and obligations \\nassociated with the transaction.  \\nIn general, consumers and businesses use “retail” payment systems, while banks and other \\nfinancial institutions access “wholesale” payment systems. Retail payment systems process \\nhigh volumes of lower-value transactions on behalf of consumers and businesses, and may \\n11  See FRB Money & Payments, supra  note  6, at 26 .

Wholesale payment systems support larger-value \\ntransactions for financial institutions and government agencies and may use some form of \\nreal time or continuous settlement.  A single form of money can use more than one payment \\nsystem; for example, private bank money (i.e., deposits) can be transferred using checks, \\nautomated clearing house (ACH) systems or debit cards.  \\nPhysical currency is the simplest form of payment and embodies many essential features that \\nnoncash payment systems seek to emulate.  A payment in cash settles immediately, does not \\nrely on an extension of credit by a third party, and enables recipients to access the proceeds \\nof a transaction immediately.  Cash is also nearly universally accepted, does not carry an \\nadditional charge or fee per transaction, and typically protects users’ privacy, which may be \\nvaluable for a wide array of consumers including vulnerable populations. \\nAt the same time, cash is inconvenient for large transactions, is vulnerable to being lost or \\ndestroyed, and cannot be sent or requested automatically; in addition, many cash transac -\\ntions14 cannot be audited.  The risk of counterfeit, theft, or error is largely borne by the direct \\nparticipants to the transaction.  As financial institutions have strengthened anti-money \\nlaundering controls, terrorists and other criminals have increasingly turned to cash to transfer \\nfunds – capitalizing on its anonymity, portability, and liquidity.15 \\nBy definition, noncash payment systems transfer money in a form other than physical \\ncurrency.  Noncash payment systems include, but are not limited to, large-value funds \\ntransfer systems, ACH operators, and credit and debit card systems.  Together, these systems \\noffer features that cash cannot: They are capable of moving large sums of money across \\ngeographic distances, are traceable, and permit some automation of payments or requests \\nfor payment.  Like cash, some noncash payment systems process transactions in real time \\nand on a transaction-by-transaction basis (referred to as “gross” settlement).16  Other noncash \\npayment systems settle batches of transactions at predetermined times (referred to as “net” \\nsettlement) or with deferred settlement of obligations.  Regardless of gross or net settlement, \\nfinal settlement for noncash payment systems generally involves central bank money, \\nminimizing the risk that transactions would not be completed at the end of a business day.  \\nNoncash payment systems are generally centrally administered, governed by mutually agreed \\n14  Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and implementing regulations, financial institutions and any nonfinancial trade or \\nbusiness must file a report concerning a transaction, or series of related transactions, in excess of $10,000 in currency. \\n31 U.S.C. § 5313 & 5331; 31 C.F.R. §§ 1010.310-330.\\n15  Department of the Treasury , 2022 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment  20 (February 2022), https://\\nhome.treasury.gov/system/files/136/2022-National-Terrorist-Financing-Risk-Assessment.pdf .\\n16  For example, the Fedwire Funds Service is “a real-time gross settlement system that enables participants to initiate \\nfunds transfer that are immediate, final, and irrevocable once processed . . .  and is generally used to make large-value, \\ntime-critical payments.” Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , Fedwire Funds Services , https://www.\\nfederalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/fedfunds_about.htm . \\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nMoney and payments\\n5upon network rules, and have defined processes in place for resolving disputes, errors, or \\nfraudulent transactions.  \\nBecause net settlement may not occur instantly, noncash payment system can expose par -\\nticipants to credit risk and liquidity risk.  Noncash payment systems that settle on a net basis \\nestablish rules, procedures and controls for managing these risks.  Noncash payment systems \\noften charge a fee for processing transactions, either per transaction or in a flat rate based on \\nvolume.   \\nCross-border payment systems\\nCross-border payments occur when persons or businesses in one jurisdiction send or receive \\nmoney from other persons or businesses in another.  Consumers in the United States typically \\nmake cross-border payments from the United States using cash, debit and credit cards, or \\nwire or ACH transfers.  For remittance transfers, cross-border payments from one person or \\nhousehold to another, money transfer operators allow consumers to use bank accounts, \\ncredit and debit cards, and cash in-store to fund transfers, making funds available to a recip -\\nient at a foreign branch or local agent, typically paid out in the form of cash but sometimes \\nalso available via check or transfers to a bank account.  For retail purchases from foreign \\nmerchants, either while traveling abroad or shopping online, consumers and businesses can \\ngenerally use credit and debit cards issued by a domestic bank for purchases.  Consumers or \\nbusinesses can also send money abroad via ACH or wire transfer.   Depending on the region, \\ncross-border retail payments can take up to multiple days to clear, and remittance payments \\ncarry fees of 6.4 percent on average, while non-remittance cross-border retail payments carry \\nfees of up to 10 percent.17\\nCross-border payments typically settle through correspondent banking networks,18 often \\non a per transaction basis for wholesale payments and a netted basis for a batch of retail \\npayments.19  Card networks rely on the correspondent banking system to settle cross-border \\npayments with each transaction relying on the issuing bank of the payer and the acquiring \\nbank of the payee.  Remittance service providers can also rely on correspondent banking \\nnetworks to send remittances to their destination, especially when the payment destination is \\nan affiliated entity.  Other remittance providers with operations at both the origin and desti -\\nnation of a payment may settle transactions on their own books, in a closed-loop system.  For \\n17  Financial Stability Board, Targets for Addressing the Four Challenges of  Cross-Border Payments  9-10 (Oct. \\n13, 2021), https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131021-2.pdf . \\n18  Correspondent banking can be defined as arrangements where one bank (correspondent) holds deposits owned \\nby other banks (respondents) and provides payment and other services to those respondent banks.

The Federal Reserve has linked the U.S. \\nACH system with local settlement systems in Canada, the Eurozone, the United Kingdom, \\nMexico, and Panama, allowing consumers and businesses to transfer funds directly from \\nU.S. bank accounts to bank accounts in those countries.21  Financial technology companies \\nare increasingly entering the cross-border payments space, particularly for peer-to-peer \\npayments.  For example, financial technology companies are entering the remittance market, \\nallowing consumers to fund “mobile wallets” online with their bank accounts and credit or \\ndebit cards and to send money directly to foreign mobile wallets.22  However, these providers \\noften must still rely on correspondent banks for settlement or provide “on us” settlement, in \\nwhich both legs of a foreign exchange transaction are settled on the books of a single bank.  \\nIncumbent money transfer operators also provide similar online services.23  Finally, even \\nwhen available, not all commercial banks offer these services on competitive terms, or at all, \\nto retail consumers. In addition, the total number of active correspondent banking relation -\\nships and active corridors has declined over the past decade.24\\nIntermediaries\\nMoney and payments often involve intermediaries.  Intermediaries, like banks and some \\nnonbanks, issue private forms of money and provide access to payment services.  \\nBanks illustrate each of these roles.  Banks issue insured deposits, uninsured deposits, and \\nother liabilities used by customers, businesses, and nonbank financial intermediaries as \\nmoney.  Banks hold money balances for depositors, some of which are available on demand.  \\nBanks enable the transfer of money through payment services, which allow their customers \\nto make payments to, or receive payments from, customers of the same or other banks.  \\nBanks also facilitate the distribution of cash from the Federal Reserve to bank customers by \\nallowing customers to convert their deposit balances into paper currency on a one-for-one \\nbasis.25  \\n20  See generally  Robert Lindley , Reducing Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk , BIS Quarterly Review  (Sept. 2008), \\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0809g.pdf .\\n21  Federal Reserve, FedGlobal ACH Payments , https://www.frbservices.org/financial-services/ach/fedglobal . \\n22  See generally  Florian Seeh, How New Entrants Are Redefining Cross-Border Payments , EY (Feb. 23, 2021), https://www.\\ney.com/en_us/banking-capital-markets/how-new-entrants-are-redefining-cross-border-payments . \\n23  See, e.g. , WesternUnion , Send Money to a Mobile Wallet , https://www.westernunion.com/fr/en/mobile-wallet.html . \\n24  Bank for International Settlements , New Correspondent Banking Data – The Decline Continues , https://www.bis.\\norg/cpmi/paysysinfo/corr_bank_data/corr_bank_data_commentary_1905.htm . \\n25  For example, bank customers often obtain cash using a debit card attached to an ATM network.

Some offer complementary financial services and are integrated with \\ne-commerce and social media platforms.  Internationally, telecoms have likewise developed \\npayments services linked to mobile phone numbers.  These services typically allow users to \\nmanage nonbank balances at a network of authorized agents, often small retailers, which \\nthey can use for payments and transfers via SMS messaging.26    \\nFinancial intermediaries are subject to regulatory frameworks at the state level, the federal \\nlevel, or both, but applicable regulatory frameworks vary by the type of institution and its \\nactivities.  Depending on their application, these frameworks may address a range of risks, \\nincluding protection of customers, the safety and soundness of the intermediary, financial \\nstability, and the smooth functioning of the payment system.  \\nUnder U.S. laws and regulations, financial intermediaries also play an important role in \\nmitigating the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing.27  To protect user privacy, \\nregulated U.S. financial institutions are generally required to maintain the security and confi -\\ndentiality of customer information and prevent unauthorized disclosure of customer financial \\ninformation.28  If the U.S. government wants to obtain financial information, authorities must \\ngenerally follow specific procedures, providing a level of protection against unwarranted \\ngovernment scrutiny and surveillance.29  \\nmakes an ATM withdrawal, a bank converts a portion of the customer’s deposit balance into cash on a one-for-one \\nbasis. In turn, banks order cash from their Federal Reserve Bank, which consists of a request for reserve balances to be \\nconverted into paper currency.  \\n26  Of note, while nonbank intermediaries clear payments, final settlement usually occurs in central bank money using a \\nbank sponsor.\\n27  Under the BSA framework, U.S. financial institutions, including banks and money services businesses (MSB), are gen -\\nerally required to fulfill a number of core obligations, including record-keeping, reporting suspicious activity, mon -\\nitoring transactions, establishing and executing customer identification programs, verifying customer identities, \\nand maintaining anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) programs.

When interacting with a seller \\nin person, merchants may present consumers with several payment options, including \\ncash, credit or debit card, prepaid card, mobile payment app, or check.  Online shopping \\nand other electronic payments might allow consumers to use some of the same options, \\nas well as bank transfers (e.g., ACH payments) or other mechanisms for making electronic \\npurchases.  A survey conducted by the Federal Reserve, illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2 \\nbelow, provides a glimpse into the payment choices made by consumers in recent years.32  \\nIt also reveals how consumer payment preferences may change over time or in different \\ncircumstances, as evidenced by the notable decrease in the use of cash during the COVID-\\n19 pandemic.33  Nevertheless, use of cash in the United States remains higher than in \\ncertain other advanced economies.34\\nFigure 1: Share of payments use (by number) over time  \\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\\n32  Emily Cubides & Shaun O’Brien, 2022 Findings from the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice , Federal Reserve Bank of \\nSan Francisco FedNotes  (May 5, 2022), https://www.frbsf.org/cash/publications/fed-notes/2022/may/2022-findings-\\nfrom-the-diary-of-consumer-payment-choice/  [hereinafter “ Diary of Consumer Payment Choice ”].

First, the laws, \\nregulations, and rules that govern consumer transactions and promote consumer \\nprotection may vary across methods of payment.  For example, the extent to which a \\nconsumer can be held liable for purchases made on a stolen card depends not just on \\nhow quickly the cardholder reports the theft, but also on whether the stolen card was a \\ncredit card or a debit card.35 \\nSpeed and cost may also vary significantly across payment methods.  While cash \\nchanges hands instantaneously, checks and bank transfers may take up to several days \\nbefore funds become available to the recipient.  And while paying via credit or debit \\ncard may be quicker in terms of funds receipt to the seller compared to checks and bank \\ntransfers, financial costs for these methods may be higher.  The cost borne by users or \\nmerchants averages nearly 2 percent and 1 percent for credit and debit card transactions, \\nrespectively.36  These high costs are shouldered by American consumers and businesses \\nat far higher levels than their European or Canadian counterparts.37  And while the costs \\nin the United States are exceeded by those in Brazil, Brazil’s recent instant payments \\ninnovation (Pix) could lower transaction costs in Brazil.38 \\nDelays and fees also affect American households and businesses as recipients of funds. \\nHigh fees contribute to many households remaining unbanked or underbanked.39  Some \\nare forced to draw against already low balances and are charged overdraft fees.  Estimates \\nsuggest that banks charge $15 billion or more each year in such fees.40 Other households \\nrely on nonbank check cashers.41\\n35  Compare  15 U.S.C. § 1643; 12 C.F.R. § 1026.12(b) (Regulation Z), with  15 U.S.C. § 1693g; 12 C.F.R. § 1005.6 (Regulation \\nE). \\n36  Bank for International Settlements, BIS Annual Economic Report 2022, III: The Future Monetary System  99, \\nhttps://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2022e3.pdf . \\n37  Id.\\n38  Id.; see also  Duarte et al., BIS Bulletin No. 52: Central banks, the monetary system and public payment infra -\\nstructures: lessons from Brazil’s Pix  (March 23, 2022), https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull52.pdf . \\n39  FDIC, How America Banks: Household Use of Banking and Financial Services  3, 55 (2019), https://www.fdic.gov/\\nanalysis/household-survey/2019report.pdf .\\n40  CFPB, CFPB Research Shows Banks’ Deep Dependence on Overdraft Fees  (Dec. 1, 2021), https://www.consumerfinance.\\ngov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-research-shows-banks-deep-dependence-on-overdraft-fees/ .\\n41  See FDIC, supra  note 39, at 55.Consumers and payments today\\n(continued from previous page)\\nMoney and payments \\n12The payment choices available to consumers must be understood within the broader \\ncontext of financial inclusion.  The percentage of the United States that is unbanked is \\nhigher than the percentage in all other G-7 countries.42  Although most U.S. households \\nmaintain bank accounts, estimates suggest that 7 million (5.4 percent of total U.S. \\nhouseholds) are unbanked, and an additional 24.2 million or 18.7 percent of U.S. \\nhouseholds have bank accounts but still rely on alternative forms of financial services, \\nsuch as check cashing and money orders.43  And certain consumers may be less willing, \\nor less able, to participate in newer forms of payments.44  Some evidence suggests that \\nlower-income consumers, for example, are several times more likely to make payments in \\ncash than consumers with higher income, even during the pandemic, as shown in Figure \\n2.45  In addition, making payments internationally can be especially slow and costly (on \\naverage 5 percent for sending remittances from the United States), placing burdens on \\nconsumers and families that need to send international remittances and may be the least \\nable to bear the cost.46   In short, not all consumers make the same payment choices or \\nhave the same access to payment options, and certain segments of the population may \\ndisproportionately bear the costs and inefficiencies of payment systems.\\n42  See The World Bank, The Global Findex Database 2021 , https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/globalfindex/\\nData  (survey data reporting 95% of individuals ages 15 and up with an account in the United States, which drops to \\n91% when considering only those in the poorest 40% of households, and is higher than the numbers reported for all \\nother G-7 countries) https://databank.worldbank.org/source/global-financial-inclusion ; see also  The World Bank, \\nDatabank: Global Financial Inclusion , https://databank.worldbank.org/source/global-financial-inclusion .\\n43  A household is “unbanked” if no one in the household had a checking or savings account; estimates for unbanked \\nhouseholds come from FDIC, supra  note 39 at 1.

Instant \\npayment systems are an important upgrade to the current payment system.

In the United States, examples \\nof instant payment systems include the Clearing House’s RTP Network (RTP), which was \\nlaunched in 2017, and the FedNow Service, which the Federal Reserve plans to launch in \\n2023.49  \\nNetwork effects support the adoption of instant payment systems: Widespread use makes it \\nmore likely that a payor can use an instant payment system to make a payment to a payee, \\nincreasing the system’s value.50  More specific factors affecting adoption of instant payment \\nsystems include the range of institutions that are eligible to participate, the number of \\ninstitutions that choose to participate, and how these institutions make the service available \\nto their customers.  For example, an easy-to-use user interface could promote greater use \\nof instant payments.51  These systems could also expand access to electronic payments to \\nunderserved or unbanked consumers.  These capabilities have been included in international \\ncontexts, demonstrating potential benefits such as competition and consumer choice.52\\nCurrently, federally insured depository institutions are eligible to participate in RTP .53 The \\nFedNow Service will be accessible by all U.S. depository institutions, as well as by U.S. \\nbranches of foreign banks.  Broadening the range of financial institutions that are eligible \\nto participate in instant payment systems, as certain foreign jurisdictions have done, could \\nhelp to enhance speed and efficiency, competition, and inclusion in payments, including \\nfor cross-border payments.54  The FedNow Service will not initially focus on cross-border \\npayments, though it may facilitate cross-border payments in the future.\\n48  See generally  Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and Markets Infrastructures , \\nDevelopments in Retail Fast Payments and Implications for RTGS Systems ( Dec.  2021) , https://www.bis.org/cpmi/\\npubl/d201.pdf ; Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and Markets Infrastructures , Fast \\nPayments – Enhancing The Speed and Availability of Retail Payments ( Nov.  2016) , https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/\\nd154.pdf .\\n49  The Federal Reserve , About the FedNow Service , supra  note 30; The Clearing House , RTP Network Frequently Asked \\nQuestions , supra  note 30.\\n50  See Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and Markets Infrastructures , Fast Payments – \\nEnhancing The Speed and Availability of Retail Payments, supra  note 48, at 11.  \\n51  See, e.g. , DUARTE et al. , supra  note 38.\\n52  William Cook, Comparing India’s UPI and Brazil’s New Instant Payment System, PIX, Consultative Group to Assist the \\nPoor ( Feb. 2, 2021 ),  https://www.cgap.org/blog/comparing-indias-upi-and-brazils-new-instant-payment-system-pix . \\n53  The Clearing House , RTP Network Frequently Asked Questions , supra  note 30.

For example, payments made across instant payment systems are generally \\nirreversible and, therefore, may expose users to increased risk-of-loss.  Financial institutions \\nthat provide instant payments may need to manage incremental financial and operational \\nrisks, including those related to intraday liquidity, anti-money laundering/countering the \\nfinance of terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance, and fraud detection, prevention, and response.  \\nHigh levels of interoperability among instant payment systems in different jurisdictions could \\nhelp reduce transaction costs, but it could also introduce new illicit finance, counterparty, \\noperational, and cyber risks.  Moreover, differences in AML/CFT obligations for institutions \\nthat directly participate in instant payment systems, such as different customer identification \\nrequirements, could complicate efforts to create a seamlessly functioning whole.\\nSince 2001, more than 60 jurisdictions across all continents have launched instant payment \\nsystems.55  These systems can have different features such as real-time gross or deferred net \\nsettlement, and different design features such as transaction value limits, among others.  \\nCertain central banks are also integrating these payment systems with shared directory \\nservices.  This integration facilitates interoperability between participating financial institu -\\ntions and payment service providers, enhancing efficiency, speed and competition.56  As part \\nof the G20 cross-border payments roadmap, jurisdictions are also considering ways to link \\ninstant payment systems and the feasibility of new multilateral platforms and arrangements \\nto improve cross-border payments.57   \\nStablecoins\\nStablecoins are digital assets issued by private entities that aim to maintain a stable value \\nrelative to a national currency or other reference assets, often utilizing distributed ledger \\ntechnology, such as blockchain.58  To maintain a stable value, many stablecoins offer a \\npromise or create an expectation that the coin can be redeemed at par upon request.59  These \\n“asset-backed stablecoins” are often advertised as being supported or backed by reserve \\nassets, which may consist of short-term or liquid debt claims (e.g., bank deposits, commercial \\nhttps://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d202.pdf . \\n55  See generally  Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and Markets Infrastructures , \\nDevelopments in Retail Fast Payments and Implications for RTGS Systems,  supra  note 48 at 2.\\n56  See Duarte et al ., supra  note 38; Derryl D’Silva et al. , BIS Papers No. 106:  The Design of Digital Financial \\nInfrastructure: Lessons from India  (Dec. 2019), https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap106.pdf . \\n57  See Financial Stability Board , Enhancing Cross-border Payments: Stage 3 Roadmap ( Oct. 13 , 2020) , https://www.\\nfsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131020-1.pdf .\\n58  See President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the \\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency , Report on Stablecoins (Nov. 2021) , https://home.treasury.gov/system/\\nfiles/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf  [hereinafter “ PWG Report ”]. \\n59  Stablecoin redemption rights can also vary considerably, in terms of both who may present a stablecoin to an issuer \\nfor redemption and whether there are any limits on the quantity of coins that may be redeemed.

In addition to the \\nissuer of the stablecoin, other intermediaries may be important to a stablecoin’s functioning.  \\nFor example, stablecoin users, like other digital asset users, may rely on a custodial wallet \\nprovider to hold the cryptographic keys associated with their stablecoins and facilitate the \\ntransmission and exchange of stablecoins.   In addition, stablecoins may also rely on market \\nstabilization mechanisms to keep the price of the stablecoin close to or at the pegged value, \\nsuch as encouraging trading by market participants.\\nWhile today stablecoins are primarily used to facilitate trading, lending, or borrowing of other \\ndigital assets, proponents believe that stablecoins could become used widely as a means \\nof payment by households and businesses, as well as offering some improvement to the \\nefficiency of cross-border payments by reducing the number of intermediaries in a payment \\nchain.  However, poorly designed or inadequately regulated or supervised stablecoin arrange -\\nments – including both issuers and custodial wallets – may introduce or amplify risks to the \\nfinancial system, consumers and investors, and illicit finance.  Appropriate regulation and \\noversight of stablecoins and stablecoin arrangements is necessary to address these risks.61  \\nSome stablecoins lack reliable means – for example, due to insufficient or illiquid reserves \\nor design flaws – to maintain a stable value.62  Failure of a stablecoin to maintain a stable \\nvalue, or loss of confidence in a stablecoin’s ability to maintain a value, could result in a run.  \\nStablecoins, including algorithmic and asset-backed stablecoins,63 have already shown that \\nthey are vulnerable to runs.  Runs can have spillover effects on digital asset markets and, \\npotentially, on the traditional financial system.  For example, markets for reserve assets could \\nexperience dislocations if stablecoin activities were to obtain significant scale and if runs on \\nstablecoins were to lead to fire sales of these reserve assets.  Exposures could create partic -\\nularly large vulnerabilities if the asset classes subjected to fire sales are also held by other \\n60  There are no standards regarding the composition of stablecoin reserve assets, and the information made publicly \\navailable regarding the issuer’s reserve assets is not consistent across stablecoin arrangements as to either its content \\nor the frequency of its release.

Validators then verify the validity of the \\ntransactions before the transactions are appended to the record of previous transactions \\nand settled.  In a permissionless blockchain, anyone can serve as a transaction validator; in a \\npermissioned blockchain, the ability to validate transactions is limited to a group authorized \\nby the operators of the system.  \\nThe design and functionality of the distributed ledger and the governance of the stablecoin \\narrangement have implications for the speed and reliability of transfers in ownership.  \\nFor example, many stablecoins currently in circulation are developed on permissionless \\nblockchains.  In permissionless blockchains, the reward for validating legitimate transactions \\nmust be sufficiently high to incentivize validators to validate legitimate, and only legitimate, \\ntransactions.  These incentive structures may result in congestion or high fees.65  By contrast, \\npermissioned blockchains may be less prone to congestion problems but might limit some \\nof the functionalities present in permissionless blockchains.  Other stablecoin ownership \\ntransfers are recorded “on the books” of an intermediary, such as a custodial wallet.66  In \\nother respects, stablecoins face many of the same basic risks as traditional payment systems, \\nincluding credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, risks arising from improper or ineffective \\nsystem governance, and settlement risk.  \\nWith respect to AML/CFT considerations, stablecoins are generally not distinct from other \\ndigital assets, and financial institutions that deal in stablecoins are subject to AML/CFT \\nobligations.  However, if a stablecoin was widely adopted globally as a means of payment, the \\nstablecoin could pose greater risks for illicit finance due to uneven implementation of global \\nAML/CFT standards for digital assets.  The liquidity of a widely adopted stablecoin could \\nalso make it attractive to criminals and the design of a stablecoin arrangement (e.g., use of \\npermissioned blockchain) could affect the implementation of AML/CFT requirements.  Both \\npossibilities would heighten the importance of effective implementation of global AML/CFT \\nregulation and supervision of digital assets to mitigate the illicit finance risks. \\n64   See generally PWG Report , supra  note 58.\\n65  See Frederic Boissay, Giulio Cornelli, Sebastian Doerr and Jon Frost , BIS Bulletin No. 56: Blockchain scalabil -\\nity and the fragmentation of crypto , https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull56.pdf . \\n66  Digital “wallets” provide a variety of services to users, including facilitating the transfer of stablecoins between users. A \\n“custodial wallet provider” is a wallet provider that users may rely on to hold stablecoins on their behalf. Wallets which \\ncan offer certain benefits but also introduce risks if appropriate safeguards are not in place.\\nMoney and payments \\n18III. Potential U.S. CBDC design choices\\nA CBDC is a digital form of a country’s sovereign currency.67  In the United States, the existing \\nforms of sovereign currency are deposits held by banks and selected financial institutions at \\nthe Federal Reserve (reserve balances) and Federal Reserve Notes (paper currency).  A CBDC \\nwould have three core features.  First, CBDC would be legal tender.  Second, CBDC would \\nbe convertible one-for-one into reserve balances or paper currency.  And third, similar to \\ntransfers of reserve balances over Fedwire or the FedNow Service, or payments with paper \\ncurrency, CBDC would clear and settle with finality nearly instantly.68\\nThis section reviews selected design choices for CBDC, including features of the CBDC \\ninstrument, intermediaries, and the payment system.69  While some features are inherent \\nto any CBDC, there are critical design choices that may influence the adoption and use of \\nCBDC.70  In addition, a distinction can be drawn between wholesale and retail CBDC both \\nin their use cases and design, with wholesale CBDC intended for banks and other financial \\ninstitutions, and retail CBDC intended to be accessed and used by a wide range of consumers \\nand businesses.71  That said, certain design features and questions related to the underlying \\ninfrastructure of CBDC may blur these distinctions to some degree.   \\nMoney\\nWholesale CBDC could be designed for large-value financial transactions.  A natural use case \\nfor wholesale CBDC would be for large-value payments, analogous to how reserve balances \\nare transferred over Fedwire.  A CBDC could also be the cash leg of a range of market trans -\\nactions, including repurchase agreements or securities purchases, instead of bank deposits \\nor reserve balances.  If provided access, nonbanks could also settle financial contracts in \\nCBDC and wholesale borrowing contracts could integrate CBDC.  A CBDC could serve as a \\nsettlement asset for “digital clearinghouses,” which could convert one type of digital asset \\ninto another, with the CBDC acting as a highly liquid bridge between assets.72\\n67  There may be other forms of digital sovereign currency. Consistent with the Executive Order, this report focuses on \\nCBDC specifically. As discussed further in Section III, the ways in which a consumer may interact with a CBDC can vary \\ndepending on particular design choices.\\n68  See generally  Board of Governors of the  FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, Service Details on Federal Reserve, Actions to \\nSupport Interbank Settlement of Instant Payments , 85 Fed. Reg. 48522 (Aug. 11, 2020).\\n69  This section discusses the policy implications of various potential features and should not be read to make any deter -\\nminations on the technological feasibility of these features. For more consideration about technical design choices, \\nsee the Office of Science and Technology Policy’s Technical Evaluation for a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency System.\\n70  The Federal Reserve outlined four key design features for U.S. CBDC: privacy-protected, intermediated, widely trans -\\nferable, and identity-verified.  See FRB Money & Payments,  supra  note 6 at 13. Broadly, the discussion in this section \\nsupports these features. \\n71  As discussed below (“Intermediaries”), a retail CBDC could use a two-tier structure in which intermediaries onboard \\nand manage payments while the central bank records account balances.  \\n72  See Bank for International Settlements Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures , Central bank \\ndigital currencies 8 ( March 2018) , https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d174.pdf . \\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nPotential U.S. CBDC design choices\\n19A retail CBDC could be designed as an alternative to payments using cash, checks, credit \\nor debit cards, or ACH.  For example, a retail CBDC could substitute for cash in low-value \\ntransactions, to the extent that it is more convenient, less prone to loss or theft, or has other \\nfeatures preferred by users.  It could also be used instead of credit or debit card substitutes \\nfor purchases online, automated bill payment, or other financial transactions.  In these \\nsettings, users could value an instrument that is a central bank liability and is continuously \\navailable.  Businesses might choose retail CBDC over ACH, instant payments or wires for \\nbusiness-to-business payments, payroll, or other financial transactions.  CBDC design \\nfeatures that users may value in these settings include flexibility, safety, security, reversibility, \\nand verifiability.  \\nA key question is whether CBDC would pay interest.  In particular, the Federal Reserve \\ncould consider whether wholesale U.S. CBDC would pay interest, as reserve balances do.73  \\nThe level of interest paid would affect wholesale U.S. CBDC’s substitutability with reserve \\nbalances or other Federal Reserve liabilities.  Paying interest could also encourage adoption \\nat the introduction of CBDC.  If the rate paid was in line with market rates, in normal times, \\nwholesale CBDC could crowd out the production of potentially risky forms of private money, \\nsuch as money issued by non-bank intermediaries, supporting financial stability.  That said, a \\nwholesale CBDC that paid interest could attract destabilizing inflows during stress, and so the \\nrate may need to adjust downwards to minimize these flows.  \\nA retail CBDC could also pay interest.  Although paper currency does not pay interest, bank \\ndeposits often do.  The retail bank deposit rate is often significantly lower than the relevant \\npolicy rate and “sticky”; as policy rates rise, deposit rates often follow sluggishly upwards.74  \\nIn theory, if an interest-bearing CBDC was viewed as a close substitute for bank deposits in \\nterms of the use cases they support, deposit and lending rates might increase.  That said, \\nthere may be practical considerations that limit this pass-through.  As with wholesale CBDC, \\nany interest paid on retail CBDC might need to adjust to minimize destabilizing flows.   \\nPayment system\\nAt its core, a CBDC system would need to support instant settlement.  In addition, the system \\nwould need to have appropriate cybersecurity incident management, contingency plans, and \\ncontinuity plans to ensure availability of its functionalities, including during natural disasters \\n73  The Federal Reserve published a discussion paper in January 2022 titled  Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in \\nthe Age of Digital Transformation . The paper discussed and sought comment on a variety of policy considerations \\nrelated to a CBDC, including implications for the implementation of monetary policy. Interest paid on Federal Reserve \\nliabilities is one aspect of monetary policy implementation that should be considered.  See FRB Money & Payments,  \\nsupra  note 6 at 21.\\n74  See John C. Driscoll & Ruth A. Judson, Sticky Deposit Rates , (working paper, Federal Reserve Board Finance & \\nEconomics Discussion Series No. 2013-80), https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201380/201380pap.pdf ;  \\nItamar Drechsler, Alexi Savov & Philipp Schnabl, The Deposits Channel of Monetary Policy , 132 Q. J. Econ.  1819 (2017). \\nPotential U.S. CBDC design choices \\n20and foreign attacks.  When problems are discovered in CBDC functionality, there would be a \\nclear process and adequate support for mitigating and resolving those problems.   A CBDC \\nsystem would also have to support mitigation of money laundering and terrorist financing \\nrisks, as well as anti-fraud measures, sufficient to overcome the risk of providing a highly \\nliquid and price-stable instrument, assuming that it is available in large quantities and that it \\nsettles instantaneously.   \\nBeyond these core features, the system could also facilitate the use of transaction program -\\nmability, to allow for additional functionality of money.  For example, payroll, government, or \\nbill payments could be automated using CBDC, similar to how ACH works today, or new func -\\ntions could be designed to facilitate micro and machine-to-machine payments.  However, \\nprogrammability could add additional risks to users (e.g., if there are bugs in the code that \\nsupport the contracts or if consumers find it more difficult to stop payments or modify their \\nagreements) and, therefore, any use of programmability should be carefully evaluated to \\nensure that these risks can be sufficiently mitigated.  \\nA range of system designs could facilitate wholesale CBDC functions that would extend \\nbeyond those offered by traditional payment systems.  Similar to Fedwire, final settlement \\ncould occur on a gross basis with instant finality, but a U.S. CBDC could be developed that \\nwould not have the current limitations in transaction timing based on Fedwire operating \\nhours.  Depending on the design features and intermediary structure, wholesale CBDCs may \\nbe able to facilitate settlement in systems or environments outside of this closed system.  \\nWholesale CBDC could facilitate the final settlement of retail payment systems and also allow \\nfor smoother overall intraday liquidity management.\\nIn terms of the underlying infrastructure, retail and wholesale CBDC could run on centralized \\npayment systems or distributed ledger technology (DL T) for processing payments.  Because \\nCBDC is a riskless liability of the central bank, current technology suggests that CBDC would \\nbe transferred on a system administered by the central bank.  Technological developments \\nsuch as DL T could enable a variety of models with roles for specialized intermediaries to initi -\\nate, process, and execute CBDC payments.  DL T-based systems could be both permissioned, \\nmeaning the network of nodes that verify or commit transactions would be pre-approved \\nentities, or permissionless, where any entity with the requisite technology and capacity could \\nact as a node.  However, a permissionless system could introduce distributed governance \\nand would present substantial risk for a CBDC, such that a central bank would be unlikely to \\nadopt it.75   \\n75  For a discussion of similar issues, see Federal Reserve Bank of Boston , Project Hamilton Phase 1 Executive Summary , \\nhttps://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/project-hamilton-phase-1-executive-summary.aspx . \\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nPotential U.S. CBDC design choices\\n21A U.S. CBDC could be designed to interoperate with foreign CBDCs to support and enhance \\ncross-border payments.  Systems could have varying levels of interoperability including sep -\\narate but compatible CBDC systems that share common technical standards and alignment \\nin their legal and regulatory frameworks, common user interfaces or clearing mechanisms \\nthat are jointly designed and developed or adopted across jurisdictions, or jointly operated \\nand governed multi-CBDC systems.  Research and experimental work have demonstrated \\nthe potential for interoperable CBDC systems to complete international transfers and foreign \\nexchange operations in seconds, compared to the days typically required for cross-border \\npayments processed and settled through correspondent banking networks.76   \\nAchieving any of these models of interoperability would require advance cooperation \\nbetween jurisdictions during the development phase to establish common standards and \\nlegal frameworks. As with other payment systems, higher levels of interoperability can \\nintroduce counterparty, operational, and cyber risks.  Interoperability between central-bank \\noperated payment systems is relatively uncommon today due to the risks and technical \\ncomplexity, as well as considerations related to jurisdictions’ economic governance, rule of \\nlaw, national security, and the need to align regulations such as data protection and privacy \\nstandards, AML/CFT regimes and the enforcement of sanctions.  These governance chal -\\nlenges would also exist for new cross-border payment systems developed using CBDCs. \\nCBDC ledger design could have significant implications for user privacy, cybersecurity, and \\nillicit finance risks.  In a system with a publicly visible ledger, user information could be \\npseudonymously recorded on the ledger, but with the passage of time and accumulation of \\ntransaction data, transactions might be attributed to individual users; therefore, a publicly \\nvisible ledger may result in reduced user privacy.  A CBDC ledger could collect significant \\namounts of information and, without appropriate safeguards, would pose privacy risks and \\ncould be a target for cyber attacks.  Finally, the ledger design would also affect the degree of \\nillicit finance risk, based on the degree of transparency into the ledger and whether the nodes \\nin a decentralized system are pre-approved entities.  \\nIntermediaries\\nThere are two general architectures for CBDC intermediation: (1) a single-tier (i.e., direct) \\nCBDC with the central bank, and (2) a two-tier CBDC where intermediaries (potentially banks \\nor nonbank financial intermediaries) would onboard and manage payments while the central \\nbank records account balances.  Under either approach an end user’s CBDC holdings would \\n76  For example, the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub’s Project mBridge designed a prototype that \\ndemonstrated that ability to effect cross-border transfer in seconds. See Bank for International Settlements , \\nInthanon-LionRock to mBridge: Building a Multi CBDC Platform for International Payments , https://www.bis.org/publ/\\nothp40.htm . \\nPotential U.S. CBDC design choices \\n22represent a direct claim against the central bank.  However, considerations for these general \\narchitectures may differ according to wholesale or retail CBDC.  \\nIn a single-tier model for retail CBDC, the central bank would issue CBDC and interact directly \\nwith the public.  The central bank would be responsible for all AML/CFT obligations, including \\ntransaction monitoring, filing suspicious activity reports, and customer due diligence.  The \\nAML/CFT obligations associated with holding these accounts would result in a government \\nentity having access to customer due diligence and transaction information for all U.S. CBDC \\ntransactions, which would represent a significant expansion of the U.S. government’s access \\nto financial data and should be carefully considered.  This model would also raise novel \\nchallenges for AML/CFT supervision, as another supervisory body would need to monitor the \\ncentral bank’s own AML/CFT compliance.  This model also could have implications for credit \\ncreation, as discussed further in Section IV. \\nA more feasible model in the United States for intermediating a retail U.S. CBDC would \\nbe a two-tiered system, which is in line with what the majority of jurisdictions globally are \\nconsidering.77  Under this model, the Federal Reserve would issue and redeem U.S. CBDC, \\nbut the distribution of U.S. CBDC would be handled by intermediaries eligible for an account \\nat the Federal Reserve and payment services would be managed by intermediaries and \\nother private sector participants.  This would be similar to how paper currency is distributed \\nthrough commercial banks.  It also shares similarities to responsibilities surrounding noncash \\nretail payments today: the intermediaries onboard, provide customer support, and manage \\npayments.  In addition, intermediaries would likely implement AML/CFT obligations, while \\nrelevant supervisors would monitor compliance with those obligations.  \\nBoth banks and nonbank financial intermediaries could support a wholesale CBDC.  In a \\nbank-based system, banks would provide all intermediation services.  In a hybrid system, \\nnonbanks could also provide custodial or wallet services.  Banks could provide a settlement \\nlayer that interacts directly with the central bank, and nonbanks could provide an interface \\nto other financial institutions for the holding or transfer of wholesale CBDC.  In all cases, \\nintermediaries would need to ensure availability of wholesale CBDC, as well as a high degree \\nof security and resilience.   \\nThere could be institution holding limits on wholesale CBDC.  A range of characteristics of \\nthe intermediary could determine holding limits, including the size of an intermediary, other \\nbusiness lines of the intermediary, supervisory concerns, or operational considerations.  \\nThere could also be more general factors, such as the degree to which U.S. CBDC outstanding \\n77  A BIS survey question showed that more than 70 percent of central banks engaged in some form of CBDC work are \\nconsidering a two-tiered model.

These limits could change in times of \\nstress.  In particular, the Federal Reserve might opt to place limits on institutional holdings if \\nflows into wholesale U.S. CBDC appeared to be destabilizing to broader money or financial \\nmarkets.  \\nBeyond these two architectures for core features, a range of intermediation models could \\napply.  Consumers could hold retail CBDC in digital wallets, similar to some private digital \\nassets and nonbank payments services.   Wallets could allow users to convert between \\nCBDC and commercial bank money or hold CBDC alongside other digital assets, promoting \\nconvenience and flexibility.  The wallets could provide payment verification services as well, \\nparticularly for larger-value transactions.  Data structures and regulatory frameworks could \\nbe established to promote consumer privacy and, as appropriate, additional standards for \\nreversibility or error mitigation. \\nThe scope of the intermediary base could also promote equity and financial inclusion.  For \\nexample, enabling a range of banks as well as potentially nonbank financial institutions to \\nprovide wallets could provide the unbanked and the underbanked with greater options for \\naccess.  A larger intermediary base could also promote competition and amortize fixed costs.\\nPotential U.S. CBDC design choices \\n24AML/CFT controls and CBDC \\nAs with any financial asset, CBDCs could be used by criminals, including terrorists, for \\nillicit activity.  Design choices of a CBDC, to include the user base, technological design, \\ndata collection, and the scope of usage, would affect the illicit finance risks posed by a \\nCBDC.  As part of CBDC design, relevant authorities and supervised intermediaries would \\nneed to assess the risks and ensure that appropriate controls are in place to mitigate \\nthose risks.  For example, the illicit finance risk posed by a wholesale CBDC, in which the \\nonly users are banks and possibly other financial institutions already subject to AML/CFT \\nobligations, would be lower than a retail CBDC with which consumers and businesses \\nconduct financial activities.\\nThe potential uses of a CBDC could also impact the illicit finance risk.  For example, a \\nretail CBDC used for low value, retail transactions or peer-to-peer transfers could be \\nabused by illicit actors looking to transfer smaller amounts of funds that may not trigger \\ntransactions monitoring systems or meet the threshold for certain AML/CFT requirements.  \\nIn addition, the more readily that CBDCs can be used for cross-border transactions, the \\nhigher the values a CBDC will support, and the more rapidly transactions take place, \\nespecially to high-risk jurisdictions, the more risk it is likely to entail.  Other critical factors \\nmay include the extent to which user data is usable by and available to investigators, the \\ntypes of intermediaries that can distribute the CBDC, the extent to which users are subject \\nto and the scope of a customer due diligence process, and whether velocity or amount \\nlimits exist. \\nAML/CFT obligations and supervision: \\nIn a two-tiered CBDC, intermediaries would be responsible for implementing all AML/CFT \\nand sanctions obligations, including customer verification, transaction monitoring, record \\nkeeping, and the filing of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs).  Regulators would also be \\nresponsible for supervising the intermediaries’ compliance with AML/CFT requirements, \\njust as they currently are.  Depending on the technical aspects of a CBDC, regulators may \\nneed additional training, expertise, or resources to adequately supervise intermediaries’ \\ncompliance with relevant AML/CFT obligations.  Additional guidance may be necessary \\nfor the industry to understand how to effectively design and implement an AML/CFT \\nprogram for CBDC.  \\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nPotential U.S. CBDC design choices\\n25User identification and privacy\\nWhile physical cash can enable anonymous transactions, a CBDC could potentially be \\nused at much greater scale and velocity, because it would not be subject to the practical \\nlimitations of paper money.  Therefore, anonymity in a CBDC system could present \\ngreatly expanded money laundering, proliferation financing, and terrorist financing risks \\ncompared to physical cash.  These risks could be more easily mitigated in an identity-\\nverified system, in which intermediaries collect and verify customer information.  Other \\nstrategies, including zero knowledge proofs, could also be explored.  A CBDC could \\nalso have tiered accounts to allow for different functionality, tied to different levels of \\nidentity verification and monitoring. Controls could be embedded into the design of any \\ntiered system to enable intermediaries to identify instances of structuring designed to \\navoid compliance thresholds.  Tiered accounts could enable customers without identity \\ncredentials, who are often unable to access traditional financial services, to access \\nCBDC.  While models that allow different levels of identity verification and monitoring \\ncould reach wider user bases and do more to promote inclusion than accounts requiring \\nfull customer due diligence, they would need to be carefully assessed and calibrated to \\nappropriately mitigate the illicit financing risks.  In addition, a tiered model would need to \\nregularly assess the illicit finance risks and, if necessary, change the tiering to adapt to an \\never-changing risk environment. \\nA CBDC can be designed to incorporate technological innovations to both enable user-\\nidentification and maximize privacy protections for users.  For example, data collected \\nshould be protected from unlawful access.  A CBDC could also incorporate trustworthy78 \\nand effective digital identity solutions that include the necessary safeguards to minimize \\nfraud, while also reducing incentives for fraudsters and hackers to steal and misuse \\npersonally identifiable information.  A CBDC could also leverage privacy-enhancing \\ntechnologies to combat illicit finance, promote inclusion, and preserve privacy.79 \\n78  “Trustworthy” digital identity is shorthand for technology and infrastructure with built-in safeguards and regula -\\ntory policies to address privacy, civil liberties, equity and other concerns.  Trustworthy digital identity solutions are \\noptional and voluntary, consent based, privacy preserving, inclusive, equitable, secure, accurate and resilient, allow \\nconsumer choice, convenient, and are subject to appropriate technical standards, trust frameworks, and governance.  \\n79  For example, in August 2020 the U.S. and U.K. governments launched a prize challenge on privacy enhancing tech -\\nnologies.

For example, automated SAR filings for certain potentially suspicious \\nactivities, such as structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements, could be \\nbuilt-in and thereby reduce the compliance burden on financial institutions.  Further work \\nwould be needed to understand how intermediaries (in an intermediated CBDC) would \\nbe responsible for developing and managing these controls.  At a minimum, standards for \\ngovernance, such as a requirement to provide explanatory information on programmable \\ncontrols to customers, would need to be developed. \\nA CBDC with a common interface for intermediaries could also provide opportunities for \\nenhanced private sector data sharing and data pooling enabling financial institutions to \\nidentify patterns and trends in money laundering and terrorist financing and improve \\ncompliance controls.80  Any data pooling efforts would need to incorporate robust \\ndata and privacy protections and could seek to incorporate technological innovations \\nto enable the identification of trends while minimizing the sharing of customer data.  \\nFundamentally, a CBDC system could increase the amount of data generated on users \\nand transactions.  The collection and storage of this data would pose obvious privacy and \\ncyber security risks, but it also could offer opportunities for proper authorities to leverage \\nthe data in supervision and law enforcement efforts.  \\n80  See generally  FATF, Stocktake on Data Pooling, Collaborative Analytics and Data Protection  (July 2021), https://\\nwww.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/Stocktake-Datapooling-Collaborative-Analytics.pdf .

Policy considerations \\nThis section reviews policy considerations related to the introduction of a CBDC.  To support \\nthe assessment of a CBDC that is required by Section 4(b) of the Executive Order, this section \\ncompares the policy implications of a CBDC with those of two recent innovations, instant \\npayments and stablecoins.  However, there are potentially significant differences in the \\nstructure, function, and regulatory status of these products, which provide important context \\nfor the comparisons below.\\nThe policy considerations discussed in this section are based on the objectives set out in \\nthe Executive Order and outlined in the Appendix.  These considerations relate to four broad \\nthemes:  \\n• Building the future of money and payments:   The future system of money and \\npayments should be efficient, provide a foundation for further technological innova -\\ntion, achieve a high degree of resilience, and facilitate cross-border transactions.  \\n• Supporting U.S. global financial leadership:  The future money and payment sys -\\ntems should be consistent with the global role of the dollar; enable the enforcement \\nof sanctions; and advance democratic values, human rights, and privacy.  \\n• Advancing financial inclusion and equity:  Innovations to payment systems, includ -\\ning a potential U.S. CBDC, should enable access to and preserve choice for a broad set \\nof potential consumers and users, particularly for those Americans underserved by \\nthe traditional banking system .\\n• Minimizing risks:   The system should be consistent with preserving economic growth \\nand financial stability, minimize the risk of illicit financial transactions, and be envi -\\nronmentally sustainable.     \\nConsideration 1: Building the future of money and payments \\nDeveloping a U.S. CBDC could support progress towards goals related to payment system \\nefficiency, technological innovation, payment system resilience, and cross-border transaction \\ncosts.  \\nPayment system efficiency\\nThe payment system should allow for efficiencies that make payments cheaper, faster, and \\nsafer, by promoting greater and more cost-efficient access to financial products and services. \\nSpeed and cost\\nA CBDC system could be faster than certain existing electronic payment systems, as a CBDC \\ncould reduce technological frictions by increasing the speed of transactions and ensuring \\nPolicy considerations  \\n30finality.85  Costs of operating a U.S. CBDC would likely be in line with those of comparable \\nprivate sector systems to comply with the Federal Reserve’s policies regarding provision of \\npriced services. 86  Even so, some consideration of the costs of developing CBDC, how these \\ncosts shift with respect to design choices, as well as the time development may take, should \\nbe noted.  \\nTransactions using instant payment systems can occur in seconds (or less), but it is possible \\nthat CBDC could offer even greater throughput. The pricing of instant payment systems to \\nparticipating institutions will depend on the costs of operating the service, plus a private-sec -\\ntor adjustment factor that imputes a profit margin.  Pricing of instant payments for consumers \\nwill depend on competitive dynamics, including the range of institutions that have access \\nto instant payment systems.  In particular, access to the FedNow Service will be hybrid, with \\nbanks and nonbank financial intermediaries sponsored by banks as service providers or \\nagents.\\nThe speed and efficiency of stablecoins relative to CBDC will depend largely on the stable -\\ncoin’s system for transferring ownership.  As discussed in Section II, stablecoins rely on a \\nvariety of different intermediaries and ledger systems.  Certain features may make stablecoins \\nprone to congestion and high and unpredictable transaction fees.  Further, if not subject to \\nappropriate regulation and oversight, stablecoins present other risks, including the risk of \\nruns. \\nTechnological innovation\\nFoundational technology\\nCBDC would provide a foundation for further innovations in payments by providing a safe \\nasset from a trusted source that can be used reliably in digital contexts.  For example, a CBDC \\ncould enable transaction programmability (i.e., being able to add rules into a CBDC system \\nsuch that those rules are executed when predefined conditions are met) or support the \\ntokenization of bank deposits or other financial assets.  Under one scenario, when a customer \\nat Bank 1 uses tokenized deposits to transact with a customer at Bank 2, a wholesale CBDC \\ncould settle the associated interbank exposures instantaneously and automatically.  CBDC \\n85  Project Hamilton, an exploratory research project involving the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the \\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology Digital Currency Initiative, has developed a CBDC architecture capable of pro -\\ncessing 1.7 million transactions per second.  Lovejoy et al., A High Performance Payment Processing System Designed \\nfor Central Bank Digital Currencies ( White Paper Feb. 3, 2022 ), https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-\\npubs/project-hamilton-phase-1-executive-summary.aspx .  \\n86  As required by the Monetary Control Act of 1980, the Federal Reserve Banks set fees for priced services provided to \\nfinancial institutions. These fees are set to recover, over the long run, all direct and indirect costs and imputed costs, \\nincluding financing costs, taxes, and certain other expenses, as well as the return on equity (profit) that would have \\nbeen earned if a private-sector business provided the services.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \\nSystem , Policies: Principles for the Pricing of Federal Reserve Bank Services , https://www.federalreserve.gov/payment -\\nsystems/pfs_principles.htm .  See also 12 U.S.C. § 248a.  \\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nPolicy considerations \\n31could also allow for nearly instantaneous settlement of a wide range of transactions on a \\n24/7/365 basis.  \\nMore generally, code for CBDC could be open source, expanding the pool of developers \\nwho can review and build on the code base, although open-source code may carry its own \\noperational risks that must be considered.  Protocols built by such developers could be \\ncombined to support additional services.87  At the same time, given the need for a CBDC to be \\nextremely reliable and stable, it may not be able to experiment with the latest technological \\ndevelopments as fast as the private sector could.  \\nInstant payment systems could also support further innovation in payments, particularly if \\nnew entrants that are able to provide innovative services to their clients participate directly \\nin these systems.  However, it is not clear that instant payment systems will support the same \\nrange of use cases as a CBDC.  Stablecoins may support technological innovation in pay -\\nments, including cross-border payments.  At the same time, these benefits may be limited or \\noffset if stablecoins remain vulnerable to runs, use blockchains that are prone to congestion, \\nor are more prone to cyber and operational risks.  \\nPublic-private partnership\\nThe payment system should support innovations from the public and private sectors to meet \\nthe various public policy goals of the United States.  In turn, innovations from partnerships \\ncould provide building blocks for other technologies, similar to how the internet was first \\nintroduced as a public-sector initiative.88  Current payment systems, including ACH, have also \\nbenefitted from public-private sector cooperation, particularly with respect to incorporating \\nnew functionality and standard setting.89  \\nBoth CBDC and instant payments could benefit from public-private collaboration.  For exam -\\nple, CBDC systems could allow for composability with private sector-developed applications, \\nwhile instant payment systems could support integration with private sector-developed \\nservices. \\nPayment system resilience\\nA payment system is resilient if it functions reliably, is capable of handling high user and \\ntransaction loads, is well-protected against cyber and operational risks, and can resume \\nnormal functioning quickly after a disruption.  \\nA CBDC should aim to be secure and functional in a range of environments, both at initial \\ndeployment and over its life cycle.  As a public good, a CBDC could be uniquely positioned to \\n87  See Bank for International Settlements , supra  note 36 at 94.\\n88  See generally  Katie Hafner , Where Wizards Stay up Late (1999) .\\n89  The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) brings together public and private ACH system repre -\\nsentatives to set standards and policies.

In addition, because it is \\npublicly provided, CBDC would be designed in ways to account for potential externalities \\ngenerated by a payment system.  As such, it might provide broader protections against cyber \\nor operational risks than a privately operated payment system would.  However, a CBDC also \\nwould be a target for cyber attackers and, therefore, would need extensive cybersecurity \\nprotection and its design would need a robust incident response program in case of a \\ncompromise.90\\nIn general, payment systems, including instant payment systems and stablecoins, should \\nconsider security and resilience when they incorporate new design features.91  Potential \\nstablecoin vulnerabilities include coding bugs in the smart contracts that support the \\nstablecoin, security issues related to the keys used to mint and burn stablecoins, and in the \\nblockchain-based applications to which users deploy them.92 \\nCross-border\\nCBDCs could also present an opportunity to rethink the international payment system.  \\nAdopting common technical standards and legal frameworks could reduce frictions in \\ncross-border payments.  Research and experimental work on cross-border multilateral CBDC \\nsystems have suggested the potential for platforms to facilitate peer-to-peer CBDC payments \\non a payment-versus-payment basis, which could reduce settlement risk and increase the \\nsettlement speed of cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions.93  \\nThere are some countervailing considerations, however.  As noted, high levels of interop -\\nerability between CBDCs could introduce counterparty, operational, and cyber risks.  \\nGovernance of a multi-CBDC system could also prove extremely challenging due to chal -\\nlenges in addressing misaligned or conflicting policy objectives in different jurisdictions and \\nevolving regulations, including data protection and privacy standards, AML/CFT regimes, and \\nthe enforcement of sanctions imposed by participating jurisdictions.    \\nInstant payment systems would not be interoperable on a global scale initially, although \\nwork is underway to facilitate fast payment system interoperability.

However, the \\nprominence of the dollar reflects factors beyond payment system efficiency.  These factors \\ninclude the United States’ strong economic performance; sound macroeconomic policies \\nand institutions; open, deep, and liquid financial markets; institutional transparency; commit -\\nment to a free-floating currency; and strong and predictable legal systems.94  \\nIn the near term, foreign CBDCs and private digital assets by themselves likely offer little new \\ncompetition to the dollar beyond traditional foreign fiat currency, particularly because they \\ndo not address the structural factors above.  Additionally, to be broadly adopted, a foreign \\nCBDC or a private digital asset would require interoperability with other payment systems or \\nwide use for payments in other jurisdictions; it would also require deep liquidity to act as a \\nmedium for cross-currency settlement. \\nNonetheless, the United States should still consider the long-term proposition of a digital \\nfuture where financial and commercial decisions are tied more closely to technological \\nefficiency and convenience.  The emergence of new payment system technologies, tokenized \\nassets, and programmable and automated financial sector activities may support the need \\nfor a tokenized version of the dollar.  \\nFiat based stablecoin demand will largely be driven (or limited) by the underlying fiat curren -\\ncies’ characteristics.  Stablecoins could affect demand for dollars globally.  The magnitude \\nand consequences of these changes depend on a range of factors, including the demand \\nfor stablecoins globally, assets backing stablecoins, and regulatory framework(s) applied \\nto stablecoins in the United States and abroad.  Cross-border use of stablecoins could also \\nintroduce unintended spillover risks.  \\nSanctions and other financial measures\\nThe United States uses sanctions and other financial measures to address national security \\nthreats and deny criminals and other illicit actors access to the U.S. and international \\n94  See U.S. Department of the Treasury , Report to Congress: Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies \\nof Major Trading Partners of the United States  19 (Dec. 2021), https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/206/\\nDecember-2021-FXR-FINAL.pdf .  \\nPolicy considerations  \\n34financial systems.95 The effectiveness of these tools rests in part on the strength and centrality \\nof the U.S. financial system and currency as well as coordination with allies and partners to \\nmagnify economic and political impact.  \\nForeign CBDCs, stablecoins, and private-sector-issued digital assets could provide new \\navenues for bad actors, such as terrorist financiers, money launderers, and governments \\nproliferating weapons of mass destruction, to fund and conduct illicit activities and evade \\nU.S. sanctions.  Foreign CBDC systems could be designed to operate outside of an integrated \\ninternational financial system, such as a bilateral payment mechanism, thus making it easier \\nfor rogue actors or countries that are subject to sanctions or disagree with U.S. sanctions \\npolicy to avoid U.S. jurisdiction by not dealing in U.S. dollars, with U.S. persons, or with \\npersons otherwise subject to U.S. jurisdiction.  The marginal use of a cross-border payment \\nsystem created in support of one or more foreign CBDCs, particularly if issued by countries \\nthat do not share U.S. values and national security goals, could help actors to circumvent U.S. \\npolicy tools. \\nIn the near term, a U.S. CBDC is not necessary to preserve effectiveness of sanctions.  \\nFundamentally, the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions relies on the central role of the U.S. dollar \\nand U.S global financial services and leadership.  As previously stated, neither foreign CBDCs \\nnor private-sector issued digital assets are likely to have a significant impact on either of \\nthese factors in the near term.  Over time, however, it is possible that a U.S. CBDC could help \\nto maintain U.S. leadership in the international financial system, and thereby contribute to \\npreserving the effectiveness of sanctions and other financial measures to address threats to \\nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  In addition, individ -\\nuals or entities transacting or holding a U.S. CBDC could be subject to U.S. jurisdiction and \\nthereby subject to U.S. sanctions. \\nMoreover, any financial institution participating in U.S. instant payment systems will be \\nrequired to adhere to U.S. sanctions, and so these systems are not expected to meaningfully \\nchange the efficacy of U.S. sanctions.  To the extent that stablecoins increase demand for \\ndollars globally, and depending on the design and compliance with sanctions obligations, \\nstablecoin arrangements could help preserve the efficacy of sanctions in the long term.  While \\nstablecoins backed by assets that are not denominated in dollars may be issued by financial \\ninstitutions that do not hold dollar-based reserves or are not U.S. persons, other involved \\nfinancial institutions may have U.S. sanctions obligations. \\n95   See generally U.S. Department of the Treasury , The Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review  (Oct. 2021), https://home.\\ntreasury.gov/system/files/136/Treasury-2021-sanctions-review.pdf ; U.S. Department of the Treasury, Fact Sheet: \\nOverview of Section 311 of the USA PA TRIOT Act  (Feb. 2011), https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/tg1056 . \\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nPolicy considerations \\n35Democratic values, human rights, and privacy\\nPayment systems, including a potential CBDC,  should be designed in a manner consistent \\nwith democratic values, human rights, and privacy.  Some countries may seek to leverage \\nnew payment systems or CBDCs to surveil citizens and possibly non-citizens, exert influence \\nor pressure on political opponents, or control economic activity.  Privacy considerations \\nmay be especially pronounced for communities hesitant or unable to engage in the existing \\nfinancial system, and for certain types of transactions that may present political or social risks \\nto individuals; specifically, members of disenfranchised communities and political activists.\\nTo promote privacy and human rights globally and to aid in adoption, CBDC should prioritize \\nprivacy and minimize the amount of transaction and personally identifiable information \\ncollected by the central bank.  The system design, deployment, and maintenance should \\nadhere to privacy engineering and risk management best practices, including disassociability, \\nthe principle of least privilege, and data minimization.96  Technological innovations, such as \\nprivacy-enhancing technologies and zero-knowledge proofs, could increase functionality \\nwhile maintaining additional privacy protections.  The United States could consider prioritiz -\\ning research and development in privacy-enhancing technologies as a critical component of \\nU.S. CBDC technological research. \\nAlong with these design considerations, a CBDC system should have a governance structure \\nthat applies to both the central bank and intermediaries, that includes consumer protections \\nto prevent the disclosure of consumer financial information and protect the user from undue \\ngovernment scrutiny.  The central bank and any third-party intermediaries should provide \\npublic guidance to users about how any financial information that must be collected will \\nbe used and protected.  These governance features should be in line with U.S. government \\nprivacy standards.97  Depending on design, a CBDC could present particularly pronounced \\nconcerns about the federal government’s access to sensitive private information and the \\ndevelopment of a U.S. CBDC may warrant the reevaluation of existing privacy standards and \\nemphasize the importance of research into privacy enhancing technology.  \\nWhether or not the United States adopts a U.S. CBDC, other countries may choose to do \\nso.  Consistent with the framework outlined in the Executive Order, the United States has an \\ninterest in ensuring that such systems are aligned with the principles of privacy, human rights, \\nand other democratic values.  As noted in our framework, the U.S. government is actively \\nengaged internationally to promote the development of digital asset and CBDC technologies \\n96  NIST defines the principle of least privilege as follows: “a security architecture should be designed so that each \\nentity is granted the minimum system resources and authorizations that the entity needs to perform its function.”  \\nMichael Nieles, Kelly Dempsey & Victoria Yan Pillitteri, NIST Special Publication 800-12 Rev. 1: An Introduction to \\nInformation Security , https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST .SP .800-12r1.pdf . \\n97  See generally  The Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a et seq. ; Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act, \\n15 U.S.C. §§ 6801 et seq.  \\nPolicy considerations  \\n36consistent with our values and legal requirements and to adapt, update, and enhance adop -\\ntion of global principles and standards for how digital assets are used and transacted. \\nThe privacy considerations implicated by instant payment systems would be similar to those \\npresented by other bank-intermediated systems, whereby banks are required to protect \\ncustomer data from disclosure.  In some cases, stablecoin transactions are recorded on a \\npublic distributed ledger.  Given advances in blockchain analytics technology, this public \\naggregation of transactions could present risks to privacy.    \\nConsideration 3: Advancing financial inclusion and equity\\nPromoting financial inclusion and equity are key goals of U.S. economic policy.98  Financial \\ninclusion and equity may be achieved by expanding equitable access to financial services, \\nparticularly for those underserved by the traditional banking system, promoting greater and \\nmore cost-efficient access to financial products and services, ensuring that the benefits of \\nfinancial innovation may be enjoyed equitably by all at their choosing, and mitigating any \\ndisparate impacts of financial innovation.99 \\nHowever, as discussed in Section II, a substantial number of American households are \\ncurrently unbanked or underbanked.  Innovations to payment systems, including a potential \\nCBDC, should enable access for a broad set of potential consumers and uses, with appro -\\npriate restrictions to mitigate specific risks, including consumer protections to address \\nresolution of errors.  \\nThe payment system should expand equitable access to deposit and payment products and \\nservices, as well as bank and other sources of credit.  This includes expanding access for \\npeople of color, rural communities, individuals without the resources to maintain expensive \\ndevices or reliable internet access, and individuals with cognitive, motor, or sensory impair -\\nments.  The payment system should also prevent harm.  Technological advances, educational \\nmaterial, and support should be leveraged to overcome the potential technical and eco -\\nnomic barriers to using a payment system that may disproportionately harm some commu -\\nnities.  If possible, offline capability should be incorporated into new payment systems.  The \\npayment system should support equity-advancing initiatives, and, with the cooperation of a \\nrange of organizations, could be used for the administration of social safety net programs. \\nA CBDC could serve the unbanked and underbanked by providing a low-cost, easily acces -\\nsible alternative to existing private sector payment services.  To do so, there would likely \\nneed to be an option for access to the CBDC that did not require technological access for \\nlower-value transactions.  This could potentially increase access to other financial services \\n98  See, e.g. , Economic Report of the President  (April 2022), https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/\\nuploads/2022/04/ERP-2022.pdf ;  FRB Money & Payments , supra  note 6, at 16.\\n99  See Exec. Order No. 14067, supra  note 1, at §2(e).\\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nPolicy considerations \\n37and reduce the need for the transfer of physical cash.  As it is designed, implemented, and \\nmaintained, a payment system that is designed by the federal government should take \\nparticular notice of E.O. 13985 ( Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved \\nCommunities Through the Federal Government ) and E.O. 14058 ( Transforming Federal \\nCustomer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government ).100\\nYet, a CBDC could also further exacerbate financial exclusion for individuals lacking reliable \\naccess to technological services, the ability to pay for any costs associated with the system, \\nthe identification or other requirements to establish accounts, or trust in the appropriate use \\nof the data collected with a CBDC system.  To mitigate the risk, a U.S. CBDC could incorporate \\noffline functionality.  At the same time, the development of a U.S. CBDC should be coupled \\nwith government efforts to increase mobile and broadband access.  The United States should \\nalso seek to maximize user choice and take steps to preserve the ability of consumers to use \\ncash.  Finally, use of a new payment system, including a potential U.S. CBDC, should not be \\nmandated.  \\nThere are potential modifications to instant payment systems that would make financial \\ninclusion aspects of CBDC and instant payment systems comparable.  Specifically, instant \\npayment systems could have an associated framework or foundation, that could include \\ntechnology, that participants could use with their communities and customers to promote \\ninclusion.  Banks could be encouraged to offer low-cost or no-cost accounts to consumers; \\nthese accounts could include access to instant payment services.  This could be a gateway \\ninto the banking system for consumers who are unbanked.  For consumers wary of the bank -\\ning system, nonbank providers offer similar accounts or other intermediation functionalities; \\nhowever, they currently generally lack direct access to Federal Reserve payment systems and \\nare not subject to comprehensive federal prudential regulation.   \\nSome proponents of stablecoins argue that stablecoins have the potential to promote inclu -\\nsion goals by reducing the cost of payments and reliance on banks and other intermediaries.  \\nHowever, the inclusion benefits of stablecoins may be limited to the extent that stablecoins \\nare not appropriately regulated, operate on networks characterized by frequent congestion \\nand high fees, or expose holders to potentially significant counterparty risk of the issuer or \\ncustodial wallet, as well as significant cyber or operational risks.  And finally, stablecoins may \\nexacerbate issues with financial inclusion in ways similar to CBDC, particularly those associ -\\nated with access to technology.  \\n100  Exec.

Reg. 71357 (Dec. 13, 2021).\\nPolicy considerations  \\n38Consideration 4: Minimizing risks \\nA system of money and payment should have design features that protect the singleness of \\nthe currency, support financial stability, preserve credit creation, minimize the risk of illicit \\nfinancial transactions, and promote environmental sustainability.  \\nSingleness of the currency\\nA key consideration is how different forms of money and payments support the singleness \\nof the currency, defined as the use of money that is dollar-denominated and convertible at \\npar from one form or issuer to another.  Cash, reserve balances, and bank deposits all satisfy \\nthese requirements.  Inconvertibility of monies has proven to amplify shocks in times of \\nstress.101  \\nFuture developments could potentially erode the singleness of the currency.  The emergence \\nof private forms of money, including digital assets, that are not subject to effective prudential \\noversight, could introduce significant levels of risk into the payment system.  Fragmentation \\nof the payment system also could result from the growth of private forms of money that are \\nnot interoperable. \\nBy construction, and assuming that a U.S. CBDC would be convertible one-for-one with \\nother Federal Reserve liabilities, a U.S. CBDC would preserve a uniform currency. 102  Even if \\nprivate-sector-issued stablecoins or other money-like digital assets continued to circulate, a \\nCBDC could be used as a settlement medium across platforms, ensuring convertibility across \\nmonies and preserving monetary sovereignty.  This could anchor confidence in money and \\nthe regulated financial system, given that banks must exchange deposits and other short-\\nterm liabilities for cash.  \\nInstant payment systems may support the singleness of the currency by providing cheap, fast, \\nand broadly accessible payment services, which could increase the attractiveness of bank \\ndeposits and thereby reduce demand for nonbank mediums of exchange.  \\nThe implications of stablecoins for the singleness of the currency are less clear.  While \\nwell-designed and regulated dollar-denominated stablecoins could support the singleness \\nof the currency, stablecoins currently are not subject to appropriate regulation and oversight \\non a comprehensive and consistent basis, and, therefore, are vulnerable to runs.  Legislation \\nto establish such a framework would mitigate these risks and help ensure that they remain in \\nplace over time.103 \\n101  See Gary B.  Gorton & Ellis W.

As with Treasury securities or \\nreserve balances, a broadly available safe asset could crowd out private money creation.104  \\nThis could support financial stability in normal times and potentially decrease the probability \\nof a crisis or losses during periods of stress.  A CBDC could also mitigate maturity mismatch \\non bank balance sheets, if deposit holders substituted towards CBDC and banks then turned \\nto alternative sources of funding.105  \\nIn addition, a U.S. CBDC could help meet global demand for dollar funding, in normal times \\nand particularly in times of stress.  Investors could obtain dollar liquidity in the form of CBDC \\nfrom banks or other intermediaries, broadening the availability of dollars in more than one \\nform and easing funding pressures in stress periods.  Meanwhile, wholesale CBDC could be \\nused for the final settlement of financial transactions, in line with principles for financial \\nmarket infrastructures that encourage money settlements to occur in central bank money.106  \\nThese safe asset benefits should be weighed against potential costs, including negative \\nimplications on credit availability to businesses or consumers.\\nUnder stress, the dynamics of CBDC holdings and substitutability could be notably different \\ncompared with normal times.  In times of stress, CBDC could attract sizeable inflows if the \\ncreditworthiness of private-sector-issued liabilities were to come into question.107  Evidence \\nsuggests that investors are more likely to shift into safer instruments if the costs of doing so \\nare relatively modest; simple interfaces or ease of transfer into CBDC could paradoxically \\nlower such costs and increase risks.108  Inflows into CBDC could be destabilizing, particularly if \\nthere was fear or contagion that led solvent or liquid banks or other institutions to be per -\\nceived as fragile.  Two tools to mitigate these inflows could be to lower the interest rate paid \\non CBDC, if that functionality was incorporated, or to impose holding limits.     \\nAuthorities would also have to consider the appropriate level of foreign access to a U.S. CBDC \\nto avoid risks of harm to the international monetary and financial system.

Inflows to safe assets \\nand runs from risky assets would likely not affect perceptions of instant payment systems.  \\nHowever, credit or liquidity concerns about institutions with access to instant payment \\nsystems could affect volumes and values transferred, and so instant payment systems need \\nto be operationally resilient to accommodate increased flows under stress.  \\nA stablecoin might attract inflows in times of stress for reasons similar to CBDC.  The extent \\nof these inflows depends on a number of factors, including features of the stablecoin and \\nfeatures of other safe assets.  On the one hand, a stablecoin might not incorporate holding \\nlimits or other checks on inflows during stress periods that a CBDC might incorporate.  On the \\nother hand, a stablecoin that is not adequately backed or perceived as safe could be subject \\nto outflows during stress periods.  Moreover, and depending on the underlying technology, \\nstablecoins may be subject to congestion and high transaction fees that could also add to \\nsystemic risk under stress.  Foreign access and use of U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins \\noutside of the United States could also raise similar issues abroad as a U.S. CBDC.\\nCredit creation\\nBanks are major providers of credit to households and businesses.  If CBDC reduces bank \\ndeposits, banks may have a more limited ability to make loans, in addition to potential \\nincreases in bank liquidity risk.  A wholesale CBDC that is available only to those institutions \\nthat currently have access to reserve balances would minimize any potential effect on credit \\ncreation at the time of implementation of CBDC.  That said, the eventual effects on banking \\nintermediation are uncertain.109  \\nThe effect of instant payment systems on financial intermediation depends on the types \\nof entities granted access to these systems: whether the ability to participate in the service \\nis limited to banks or extended to nonbanks.  Limiting participation largely to banks, as \\nis the current state, could minimize disruption to credit creation, but doing so would also \\ndampen potential benefits arising from increased competition or access to payment systems, \\nincluding to underserved communities.  While nonbanks can participate in instant payment \\n109  Some research suggests that total intermediation would remain unchanged, although the funding of intermedia -\\ntion could shift.

Brunnermeier & Dirk Niepelt, On The Equivalence of Private and Public Money , 106 J. \\nMonetary Econ. 27 (2019) .\\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nPolicy considerations \\n41systems through a bank, offering direct access could provide additional competitive or access \\nbenefits.\\nBecause stablecoins are currently issued by nonbanks, the effects of stablecoins on financial \\nintermediation would depend more on how stablecoins are issued and the extent to which \\nthe assets backing stablecoins include loans or other private credit.  To the extent that the \\nassets backing stablecoins do not support private credit, negative effects on intermediation \\ncould be more pronounced.  \\nIllicit finance \\nCriminals and illicit actors can abuse financial technology and services to make fraud \\nschemes, drug sales, corruption, and ransomware attacks more effective and profitable, and \\nachieve other illicit ends.  The United States has a fundamentally strong and effective AML/\\nCFT regime designed to detect, report, and disrupt illicit financial activity.  The regime is \\ndesigned to bring transparency to the movement of money within the U.S. financial system, \\nprevent the flow of illicit funds, and enable the reporting of suspicious transactions by U.S. \\nfinancial institutions when identified.\\nThe FATF standards call for CBDCs to be subject to the same standards as fiat currency and \\nthe G7 policy principles for CBDC acknowledge that a CBDC issuer needs to integrate a com -\\nmitment to mitigate their use in facilitating crime.110  As a leader in the international financial \\nsystem, a U.S. CBDC should be designed to promote AML/CFT compliance and mitigate illicit \\nfinance risks.  This should include a form of effective identity verification and enough access \\nto data to enable compliance with AML/CFT obligations such as transaction monitoring or \\nrecord keeping, as necessary, as well as ensuring that intermediaries are supervised by the \\nappropriate regulatory authority.  In line with the risk-based approach, a CBDC system could \\nalso use access tiering based on user accounts, such as where account restrictions (e.g., \\nholding and/or transaction limits) are imposed based on the level of identity verification.  \\nThe development of foreign CBDCs with inadequate AML/CFT controls could also pose risks \\nto the international financial system.  For example, a foreign CBDC that allows anonymity \\nat-scale could allow malign actors, such as sanctioned individuals, to move, hold, or launder \\nillicit funds with the liquidity and anonymity of cash but without some of its practical \\nlimitations.  \\nTo promote foreign CBDCs with strong AML/CFT controls, the U.S. should work with the G7 \\nand other allies and partners to consider leading cross-border payment experiments focused \\non innovations in AML/CFT compliance for cross-border CBDCs.  The United States should \\nalso work with allies and partners to address the risks of a potential foreign CBDC used to \\n110  See FATF , supra  note 82, at 26–27; G7, supra  note 83, at 10.\\nPolicy considerations  \\n42evade sanctions which will be critical because of the network effect in international currency \\nadoption.  The U.S. should also work through the FATF to monitor emerging AML/CFT risks \\nposed by CBDCs.\\nAny financial institutions with access to U.S. instant payment systems or stablecoin service \\nproviders operating in the United States would be generally subject to U.S. AML/CFT obliga -\\ntions.  Stablecoins are generally not distinct from other digital assets, and financial institu -\\ntions offering services in stablecoins in the United States are subject to the same AML/CFT \\nregulatory and supervisory framework as financial institutions providing the same services \\nwith other financial instruments. \\nGlobally, most countries lack effective AML/CFT regulatory frameworks for digital assets, \\nincluding stablecoins, that are in line with the global standards.111  Illicit actors can exploit \\nthese gaps by using services in countries with weak regulatory and supervisory regimes to \\nlaunder funds, store proceeds of crime, or evade sanctions in stablecoins or other digital \\nassets.  The liquidity of a widely adopted stablecoin could make stablecoins more attractive \\nto criminals which would heighten the importance of effective global regulation and supervi -\\nsion of digital assets.  \\nEnvironmental sustainability\\nThe United States has set overarching environmental priorities, including cutting U.S. \\ngreenhouse gas pollution by 50-52 percent by 2030 and transitioning to a net-zero emissions \\neconomy by 2050.112  A new payments system or improvements to existing payment systems \\nshould be compatible with these priorities and seek to minimize energy use, resources, \\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and other pollution, and improve environmental performance \\nrelative to the status quo of the existing payments system.\\nReflecting these priorities, forms of money and payment need to be environmentally sus -\\ntainable.  If based on a blockchain, a U.S. CBDC would likely use a permissioned blockchain, \\nwhich consumes relatively less energy than a permissionless implementation, as the majority \\nof the energy use from permissionless blockchains derives from the consensus mechanism.113  \\nIn addition, policymakers could require energy efficiency as a key tenet of the development \\n111  FATF, Targeted Update on Implementation of FATF Standards on Virtual Assets-VASPs 7  (June 2022), https://\\nwww.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Targeted-Update-Implementation-FATF%20Standards-\\nVirtual%20Assets-VASPs.pdf . \\n112  See U.S. Dep’t of State & Exec.

The proof-of-work consensus mechanism \\nassociated with certain blockchains uses more energy than some countries do.114  Therefore, \\nstablecoins that rely on proof-of-work blockchains likely represent the least efficient option \\nfrom a sustainability perspective.

Recommendations\\nWhile the current U.S. system of money and payments has significant strengths, the United \\nStates also needs to continue to innovate in support of its policy objectives.  As set out in the \\nExecutive Order and outlined in the Appendix of this report, these objectives center around \\nthemes of developing a future system of money and payments that promotes U.S. values, \\nfosters inclusion, and minimizes risks.  The following recommendations would help achieve \\nthese objectives.  The recommendations are for the U.S. government to:\\nRecommendation 1: Advance work on a possible U.S. CBDC, in case one is \\ndetermined to be in the national interest.\\nA U.S. CBDC has the potential to offer significant benefits, but further research and develop -\\nment on the technology that would support a U.S. CBDC is needed, and could take years.  A \\nU.S. CBDC could contribute to a payment system that is more efficient, provides a foundation \\nfor further technological innovation, facilitates more efficient cross-border transactions, and \\nis environmentally sustainable.  It could promote financial inclusion and equity by enabling \\naccess for a broad set of consumers.  In addition, it could be designed to foster economic \\ngrowth and stability, protect against cyber and operational risks, be consistent with individual \\nrights, and minimize risks of illicit financial transactions.  \\nA potential U.S. CBDC could also have national security implications, and should be designed \\nto help preserve U.S. global financial leadership, and support the effectiveness of sanctions. \\nMoreover, the United States should ensure that international standards for CBDCs are consis -\\ntent with U.S. values and priorities like protecting privacy and combatting illicit finance.\\nStill, there could be unintended consequences of a U.S. CBDC, including runs to U.S. CBDC in \\ntimes of stress, which could pose risks to financial stability; a reduction in credit availability; \\nor higher credit costs for businesses and governments.  Moreover, a U.S. CBDC must be \\nextremely reliable and, for that reason, technological experimentation with U.S. CBDC may \\nnot be at the same speed as private sector payment innovations.  \\nThe Federal Reserve published a discussion paper in January 2022 titled Money and \\nPayments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation .115  The discussion paper \\nsolicited comments on a variety of policy considerations and noted that the Federal Reserve \\nwill only pursue a U.S. CBDC in the context of broad public and cross-governmental support.\\nThe Federal Reserve is encouraged to: continue its research and technical experimentation \\non CBDCs, including its work on analyzing the possible choices of technology and other \\ndesign elements of a CBDC; continue evaluating policy considerations as described in its \\nJanuary 2022 discussion paper; find mechanisms to provide the public with periodic updates \\n115  FRB Money & Payments , supra  note 6.\\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\n Recommendations\\n45on these initiatives, given the strong public interest in this topic; and consider how research \\nand development on digital assets and other related innovations that is conducted or sup -\\nported by other Federal agencies could support a U.S. CBDC.\\nTo support the Federal Reserve’s efforts and to advance further work on a possible U.S. CBDC, \\nactions in the following areas should be taken:\\n• The Treasury Department will lead an inter-agency working group (“CBDC Working \\nGroup”) to coordinate and consider implications of adoption of a U.S. CBDC for policy \\nobjectives such as national security, democratic values, the smooth functioning of the \\ninternational financial system, financial inclusion, and privacy.  The CBDC Working \\nGroup will continue to assess the merits of a CBDC and leverage cross-government \\ntechnical expertise to the extent useful for Federal Reserve efforts.  \\n• The CBDC Working Group will engage in information sharing with allies and partners \\non CBDC policy priorities, and support the Federal Reserve, as appropriate, in engag -\\ning with allies and partners to promote shared learning and responsible development \\nof CBDCs. \\n• The principals and/or deputies of the Federal Reserve, National Economic Council, \\nNational Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the \\nTreasury Department will meet regularly to discuss the progress of the CBDC Working \\nGroup and share updates on CDBC and other payments innovations.  Representatives \\nfrom other offices and agencies within the Executive Branch will join, as appropriate.\\nRecommendation 2: Encourage use of instant payment systems to support \\na more competitive, efficient, and inclusive U.S. payment landscape.\\nNew instant payment systems have been recently developed or are scheduled to launch \\nsoon, capable of handling higher volumes of transactions at lower cost than some current \\npayment systems.  Experience with instant payment systems around the world suggests that \\nenhancements are possible to make the payment system more competitive, efficient and \\ninclusive and might also reduce the costs of cross-border transactions.  \\nYet frictions may limit the extent to which the potential benefits of instant payment systems \\nare realized.  Consumers, businesses, and financial institutions may need to adjust their \\nfinancial habits and practices to incorporate new technologies.  In addition, some instant \\npayment systems are directly accessible only by depository institutions or members of \\nthe Federal Reserve System.116  Potential improvements to cross-border payment systems \\npresent a range of challenges, including governance issues and risks that might arise when \\nconsidering interoperability of cross-border systems. \\n116  Federal Reserve System , supra  note 30 . \\n Recommendations \\n46The U.S. government should consider the following actions related to instant payment \\nsystems:  \\n• The U.S. government should continue its outreach efforts to consumers, businesses, \\nand financial institutions, with a focus on inclusion of underserved communities.  \\nInternational engagement should also continue.  \\n• The U.S. government should promote development and use of innovative access \\ntechnologies by payment providers, to facilitate greater consumer access to, and use \\nof, instant payment systems.  These efforts could include continued engagement in \\nstandard setting, including for interoperability, clarification of regulatory frameworks \\nwhere necessary, and potentially public-private partnerships to explore possibilities \\nfor low-tech instant payment system access.  These efforts also could include \\nconsidering the potential benefits and drawbacks of expanding eligibility to directly \\nparticipate in instant payment systems, as discussed in Recommendation 3. \\n• In settings where appropriate, U.S. government agencies should consider and \\nsupport the use of instant payment systems.  The U.S. government sends and receives \\nmillions of payments per day.  Use of instant payment systems by U.S. government \\nagencies could promote the expedient distribution of disaster, emergency or other \\ngovernment-to-consumer payments, potentially providing more rapid support for \\nunderserved communities.  \\nRecommendation 3: Establish a federal framework for payments \\nregulation to protect users and the financial system, while supporting \\nresponsible innovations in payments. \\nThe United States should promote responsible innovations in payments.  Nonbanks are \\nincreasingly providing payment services, including issuing money (or money-like) liabilities \\nand processing payments.  On the one hand, participation by nonbank payments companies \\nmay contribute to higher levels of competition, inclusion, and innovation.  On the other, if \\nthese firms are not adequately regulated and supervised, there may be risks to consumers, \\nthe financial system, and the broader economy.  A federal framework for payments regulation \\nwould help to realize the benefits from nonbank payment providers while minimizing the \\nrisks.  Accordingly, Treasury recommends consideration of the establishment of a federal \\nframework for nonbank payment providers that would complement existing federal require -\\nments, including for consumer protection and AML/CFT . \\nA federal framework for payments regulation could support responsible innovation in \\npayments by establishing appropriate federal oversight of nonbank companies that are \\ninvolved in the issuance, custody, or transfer of money or money-like assets.  Today, nonbank \\npayment providers are subject to some federal requirements, but are otherwise regulated \\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\n Recommendations\\n47and supervised at a state level.117  State oversight of nonbank payment providers varies \\nsignificantly, and is generally not designed to address run risk, payments risks, or other opera -\\ntional risks in a consistent and comprehensive manner.118  A federal framework for payments \\nregulation would provide a common floor for minimum financial resource requirements \\nand other standards that may exist currently at the state level, and thus build on existing \\nstate frameworks.  In considering and developing a federal framework, policymakers would \\nconsider existing state and federal standards, the nature and risks of payment activities, and \\ndevelopments in payments.  Such a framework would also complement existing federal AML/\\nCFT obligations and consumer protection requirements that apply to nonbank payment \\nproviders. \\nIn addition, a federal framework for payments regulation could support considerations for \\nboth a U.S. CBDC and instant payments.  As discussed above, a U.S. CBDC system may rely on \\nintermediaries for a wide range of services, including payment services, custody, and distri -\\nbution. A federal framework for payments regulation would provide a clear basis for oversight \\nof such firms.  In addition, an appropriate federal framework for payments regulation could \\nprovide a pathway for allowing nonbank payment providers to participate directly in instant \\npayment systems (see Recommendation 2).119 \\nRecommendation 4: Prioritize efforts to improve cross-border payments. \\nPrivate sector payment innovations have been driven in part by inefficiencies in the current \\ncross-border payment systems. To respond to these inefficiencies, countries are making \\nefforts to enhance cross-border payments, both through improvements to existing systems \\nand also with forward-looking work that leverages new technologies.  The United States \\nalso has a strong national interest in being at the forefront of technological development \\nand supporting global standards for cross-border payment systems that reflect U.S. values, \\nincluding privacy and human rights; are consistent with AML/CFT considerations; and protect \\nU.S. national security.   \\nThe United States is already very active in efforts to improve cross-border payments, includ -\\ning through the G20, FSB and Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI). In \\n2020, the G20 endorsed a roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments, which sets out an \\n117  Federal law applies to some aspects of payment services, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Bank \\nSecrecy Act.

These efforts should be elevated and prioritized \\nto achieve outcomes in coordination with other jurisdictions, including but not limited to:\\n• Fostering the safety and soundness of private and public sector innovations for \\ncross-border payments, while protecting U.S. national security; \\n• Considering the feasibility of new multilateral platforms and arrangements for \\ncross-border payments, including utilizing instant payments;\\n• Working across jurisdictions to align regulatory, supervisory, and oversight frame -\\nworks for cross-border payments; and\\n• Harmonizing data and market practices for cross-border payments. \\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\n Recommendations\\n49VI. Appendix: Policy objectives \\nThis Appendix sets out eight principal policy objectives, drawn from Executive Order 14067, \\nthat inform this Report’s analysis of payment system innovations, including a potential U.S. \\nCBDC. Because this Appendix may also serve as a set of shared objectives for other reports \\nrequired by Executive Order 14067, some of the concepts previewed here are more appropri -\\nate for in-depth consideration by other reports.\\n1. Provide benefits and mitigate risks for consumers, investors, and businesses120\\na. Consumers, investors, and businesses should be financially protected\\nb. Consumers, investors, and businesses should be digitally protected\\n2. Promote economic growth and financial stability and mitigate systemic risk121\\na. The payment system should support economic activity\\nb. The payment system should ensure the resilience of the financial system\\nc. The payment system should be operable in normal circumstances and under stress\\n3. Improve payment systems122\\na. The payment system should be functional\\nb. The payment system should be efficient\\nc. The payment system should be secure\\nd. The payment system should be flexible \\n4. Ensure the global financial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity, and \\nplatform and architecture interoperability or transferability, as appropriate123 \\na. The payment system should be appropriately interoperable.\\n5. Advance financial inclusion and equity124\\na. All should be able to use the payment system\\nb. The payment system should expand equitable access to the financial system\\n120  See, e.g. , Exec. Order No. 14067, 87 Fed. Reg. 14143 (March 9, 2022)  §§ 1; 2(a); 2(d); 4(a)(i); 5; 8(a)(i); 8(a)(v).\\n121  See, e.g. , id. at §§ 1; 2(b); § 4(a)( i); 4(a)(iii); 4(b); 4(b)(i); 6; 8(a)(i).\\n122  See, e.g. , id. at §§ 1; 2(d); 2(e); 4(a)(i); 4(a)(iii); 4(b); 4(c); 8(a)(ii); 8(a)(iii).\\n123  See, e.g. , id. at §§ 2(d); 4(a)(ii); 4(a)(iii); 8(a)(ii); 8(a)(v).\\n124  See, e.g. , id. at §§ 1; 2(e); 4(a)(i); 4(a)(iii); 4(b)(ii); 5(a).6. Protect national security125\\na. The payment system should promote compliance with AML/CFT requirements and \\nmitigate illicit finance risks\\nb. The payment system should support U.S. leadership in the global financial system, \\nincluding the global role of the dollar\\n7. Provide ability to exercise human rights126\\na. The payment system should respect democratic values and human rights.\\n8. Align with democratic and environmental values, including privacy protections127 \\na. Sensitive financial data should be private\\nb. The payment system should be sustainable\\n125  See, e.g. , id. at §§ 1; 2(c); 2(d); 2(f); 4(a)(i); 4(a)(iii); 4(b)(v); 4(b)(vi); 7; 8(a)(i).\\n126  See, e.g. , id. at §§ 1; 2(f); 4(a)(i); 4(b)(vi).\\n127  See, e.g. , id. at §§ 1; 2(a); 2(c); 2(d); 2(f); 4(a)(ii); 4b(iv); 4(b)(vii); 5(b); 5(b)(v); 8(a)(ii); 8(a)(v).\\nThe Future of  Money and Payments\\nAppendix: Policy objectives \\n51  This page has been intentionally left blank.'"
